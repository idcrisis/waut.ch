Utility for background calibration, curation and tuning of the device towards an intuitive interface. 

Subsystems being battery, entropy, encryption, disk, cpu, memory, filesystem, ui, scheduler, and network, all safe and open source technology. 

Presented in this gaming metric format with infinite feedback and an interestingly assymetric chance. scribble anywhere, check in some stress, or get lucky for that matter!

ARM variants of Android only Donut 1.6+

Please uninstall either Seeder or CrossBreeder prior to using this.

Root recommended, else reactivity metric is interesting and introduces uniqueness into the entropy pool anyway.  Metric may demonstrate a certain asymmetry that is expected from predictable human actions. Efforts have been made to remove time seed logic from haveged in order to improve upon encryption and system-wide performance and security.

Also numerous other subsystems require careful calibration to facilitate this process.

Rewritten code, subset of functionality for upstream project - CrossBreeder ( https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2113150 )

Please feel free to view and analyze source and functionality and report bugs and discuss etc on the XDA forum: 

( https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-waut-ch-calibration-android-t3549967 )

Please visit: /data/data/ch.waut/files/bin on the device itself for partial shell source code and XDA Downloads section and Github for full source code.

Thanks.
